## 📖 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Recent industrial incidents, such as the Vishakhapatnam Gas Leak (2020) and the Ennore Ammonia Gas Leak (2022), highlight the limitations of traditional monitoring systems. These systems are often stationary, costly, and lack real-time data capabilities, making them inadequate for widespread and effective environmental monitoring.

### Need for a Mobile & Integrated Approach
- **Immobility of Traditional Systems**: Limited coverage and high costs.
- **Need for Real-time Data**: Lack of widespread deployment and data accessibility.
- **User-friendly Tools**: Essential for citizen science initiatives and broader applications.

### IWDS as a Solution
- **Mobile Platform**: Equipped with various sensors to collect environmental data.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Generates alerts based on air quality levels.
- **User-friendly Web App**: Provides real-time data access.

## ✨ Features
- **Mobility and Wider Coverage**: Enables data collection across diverse locations.
- **Multi-parameter Sensing**: Measures various environmental parameters.
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Access data through a user-friendly mobile web app.
- **Diverse Applications**: Suitable for personal monitoring, awareness campaigns, and research.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or yarn (>= 1.x)

### Installation

## 📖 Usage

### Dashboard Navigation
- **TopBar Component**: The top navigation bar that includes essential navigation items like "Logout".
  ```jsx
  const navItems = ["Logout"];
  ```

### Scroll Effects
- **ElevationScroll**: Adds elevation to the component when the user scrolls.
  ```jsx
  function ElevationScroll(props) {
    const { children, window } = props;
    const trigger = useScrollTrigger({
      disableHysteresis: true,
      threshold: 0,
      target: window ? window() : undefined,
    });
    return React.cloneElement(children, {
      elevation: trigger ? 4 : 0,
    });
  }
  ```

- **ScrollTop**: Scrolls the component to the top when triggered.
  ```jsx
  function ScrollTop(props) {
    const { children, window } = props;
    const trigger = useScrollTrigger({
      target: window ? window() : undefined,
      disableHysteresis: true,
      threshold: 100,
    });
  }
  ```

### Customization
- **PropTypes**: Ensure the components receive the correct props.
  ```jsx
  ElevationScroll.propTypes = {
    children: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
    window: PropTypes.func,
  };

  ScrollTop.propTypes = {
    children: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
    window: PropTypes.func,
  };
  ```
